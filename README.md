# Premier League Memory Game

### Overview
- An English Premier League-themed memory game made with React.
- User score increments when clicking an image for the first time. Score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
